## Things that work

- [x] Graphical comparison of test pgm vs output pgm (`bin/compare_output.py`)

- [x] Training neural net against pgm data (`bin/train_nn.py` hard-coded to
  train simplest data set)

## Working on

- [ ] Training simple neural net against height data

- [ ] Train with cross-validation set

- [ ] Theano?

- [ ] OO-ify some of the NN stuff
